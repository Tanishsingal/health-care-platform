# Nurse Portal - Dynamic Implementation

## Overview
The nurse portal has been transformed from using hardcoded data to fetching real-time data from the database, providing nurses with accurate, up-to-date patient care information.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. API Endpoint
**Location:** `app/api/nurse/dashboard/route.ts`

#### Features:
- **Authentication**: Verifies user is a nurse
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches current patient information
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Aggregates data from various tables
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing tables

#### Data Fetched:
1. **Nurse Profile**
   - First name, last name
   - Email and phone

2. **Today's Appointments**
   - Appointment details
   - Patient information
   - Doctor information
   - Status (scheduled, confirmed, in_progress)

3. **Assigned Patients** (Last 50)
   - Patient demographics
   - Medical record numbers
   - Blood group
   - Contact information

4. **Pending Tasks**
   - Medication administration (from prescriptions)
   - Lab test sample collection
   - Test processing
   - Priority levels (High/Medium)

5. **Statistics**
   - Total assigned patients
   - Today's appointments count
   - Pending tasks count
   - Urgent alerts count

### 2. Updated Nurse Portal Page
**Location:** `app/nurse/page.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- ✅ Removed hardcoded `NURSE_DATA` constant
- ✅ Added `dashboardData` state management
- ✅ Implemented data fetching from API
- ✅ Added loading states
- ✅ Added empty states for no data
- ✅ Improved UI with hover effects
- ✅ Dynamic statistics display

## 🎯 Features

### Dashboard Statistics
Real-time cards showing:
- **Assigned Patients**: Count of active patients
- **Today's Tasks**: Number of pending tasks
- **Appointments**: Today's scheduled appointments
- **Alerts**: Count of urgent/high-priority items

### Assigned Patients List
- Patient name and medical record number
- Blood group information
- "View Chart" button for each patient
- Empty state when no patients assigned
- Hover effects for better UX

### Pending Tasks
Tasks are derived from:
1. **Medication Administration**
   - From prescriptions with 'pending' status
   - Today's prescriptions only
   - High priority

2. **Lab Tests**
   - Sample collection tasks
   - Test processing tasks
   - Status-based priority (ordered = High, in_progress = Medium)

Each task shows:
- Task type/description
- Patient name
- Priority badge (High/Medium)
- Time scheduled

### Quick Actions
- Record Vitals
- Update Charts
- Add Note

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. User loads nurse portal
   ↓
2. Authenticate user (verify role = 'nurse')
   ↓
3. Fetch dashboard data from /api/nurse/dashboard
   ↓
4. API queries multiple tables:
   - user_profiles (nurse info)
   - appointments (today's schedule)
   - patients (assigned roster)
   - prescriptions (medication tasks)
   - lab_tests (sample collection tasks)
   ↓
5. Aggregate and calculate statistics
   ↓
6. Return formatted data to frontend
   ↓
7. Display in dashboard UI
```

## 🔧 API Response Structure

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    profile: {
      first_name: string,
      last_name: string,
      phone: string,
      email: string
    },
    todayAppointments: [
      {
        id: string,
        appointment_date: string,
        duration_minutes: number,
        reason: string,
        status: string,
        patient_first_name: string,
        patient_last_name: string,
        medical_record_number: string,
        doctor_first_name: string,
        doctor_last_name: string
      }
    ],
    assignedPatients: [
      {
        id: string,
        user_id: string,
        medical_record_number: string,
        blood_group: string,
        first_name: string,
        last_name: string,
        phone: string,
        date_of_birth: string
      }
    ],
    pendingTasks: [
      {
        id: string,
        task: string,
        patient: string,
        priority: 'High' | 'Medium',
        time: string,
        status: string,
        medical_record_number: string
      }
    ],
    stats: {
      assignedPatients: number,
      todayAppointments: number,
      pendingTasks: number,
      urgentAlerts: number
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Nurses:
1. Login with nurse credentials
2. Dashboard loads automatically
3. See real-time patient assignments
4. View today's tasks and priorities
5. Access quick actions for common workflows

### Task Priority Logic:
- **High Priority**: 
  - Medication administration (prescriptions)
  - Lab tests with "ordered" status
- **Medium Priority**: 
  - Lab tests with "in_progress" status

### Empty States:
- Shows helpful messages when no data
- Icons for visual clarity
- Encourages action when appropriate

## 🔒 Security

- **Authentication**: Token-based verification
- **Authorization**: Role check (must be nurse)
- **Data Isolation**: Only fetches relevant nurse data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if tables don't exist

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

1. **Limited Queries**: Fetches only necessary data
2. **Result Limits**: 
   - 50 most recent patients
   - 20 most recent lab tests
   - 10 pending prescriptions
3. **Efficient JOINs**: Optimized SQL queries
4. **Try-Catch Blocks**: Non-breaking error handling

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Enhancements:
- ✅ Loading spinner while fetching data
- ✅ Hover effects on patient cards
- ✅ Color-coded priority badges
- ✅ Empty state illustrations

- [x] Patient list displays correctly
- [x] Tasks show proper priorities

## 📝 Notes

### Data Dependencies:
- Requires active user_profiles table
- Works with or without appointments table
- Works with or without prescriptions table
- Works with or without lab_tests table
- Gracefully degrades if tables are missing

### Task Generation:
Tasks are dynamically generated from:
1. Pending prescriptions (current day)
2. Ordered lab tests (awaiting sample collection)
3. In-progress lab tests (awaiting results)

If these tables don't exist, the dashboard will show 0 tasks.
